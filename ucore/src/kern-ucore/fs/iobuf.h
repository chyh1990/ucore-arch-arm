 *
 * After calling,

 *   (2) iobuf's offset will have been incremented by the amount transferred;
 *   (3) iobuf's resid will have been decremented by the amount transferred;
 *
 * iobuf_move() may be called repeatedly on the same iobuf to transfer
 * additional data until the available buffer space the iobuf refers to
 * is exhausted.

 * Note that the actual value of iobuf's offset is not interpreted. It is
 * provided to allow for easier file seek pointer management.
