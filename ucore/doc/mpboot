There is a booting code in the supervisor module. The module boot a AP
from realmode into long mode, then initialize the lapic. Before
starting the universal startup algorithm, lapic and ioapic should be
set in the BSP. The booting code is copied into 0x8000 and some data
in set into the 0x7Fxx area.
